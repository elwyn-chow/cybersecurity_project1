## Activity File: Interview Questions

- This first project covers a wide range of topics including cloud, network security, and logging and monitoring.

- When networking and talking to potential employers, you should be able to reference the work done on this project to answer specific interview questions or demonstrate your skills within a specific domain. 

- You will choose a domain that you're interested in pursuing as a career and answer mock questions based on the suggested response format. 
​
### Instructions 

1. Choose one of the following domains:
    - Network security
    - Cloud security
    - Logging and monitoring

    If you are unsure of which domain you want to focus on, that's okay. You can either choose the one you're most comfortable discussing, or complete the tasks in two or all three domains.

2. Select one domain and one question. 

    - Questions are provided for each domain. Choose one to answer from your chosen domain. 
​
3. Write a one-page response that answers the question using specific examples from your work on Project 1. Your response should flow and read like a presentation while keeping the general structure of the technical question response guidelines. 

    You will submit this one-page response. 

#### Reminder: Response Guidelines
As a reminder,  good responses do the following. 
​
1. Restate the problem.
2. Provide a concrete example scenario.
3. Explain the solution requirements.
4. Explain the solution details.
5. Identify advantages and disadvantages of the solution​.
​
Including each of these components will ensure you prove your competency of subject matter and critical thinking. 
​
### Interview Questions by Domain

Below you will find a list of questions, grouped by specific domains. Select one question to answer. 
​ 

For each question, where appropriate, we have provided you with specific prompts to consider as you structure each section of your response. Feel free to use these prompts or your own examples. 

**Question 2: Unsecured Web Server**

Suppose you find a server running HTTP on port 80, despite compliance guidelines requiring encryption in motion. What do you do?
​​
1. Restate the Problem

2. Provide a Concrete Example Scenario
    - In Project 1, did you have servers running HTTP on port `80`?  If so, why was it permissible to do so?
    
    - In a real deployment, which specific machine would you configure differently? How, and why?

3. Explain the Solution Requirements
    - Why is running HTTP on port `80` a potential problem?
    - How would you reconfigure a server to serve HTTP traffic safely?
    - How does this solution fix the problem?

4. Explain the Solution Details
    - Which tools and technologies would you use to implement this solution in Project 1?
    -  How, specifically, would you use these tools to harden your deployment?

5. Identify Advantages and Disadvantages of the Solution
    -  Will your solution break clients that used to communicate with the server over port `80`?
    -  Do you have to do any work to keep this solution running longterm? Or can you simply "set it and forget it?”
